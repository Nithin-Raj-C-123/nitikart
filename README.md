🛍️ NithinKart – Enhanced E-Commerce Website
📌 Project Description

NithinKart is a fully responsive, feature-rich client-side e-commerce web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project simulates a real-world online shopping platform where users can register/login, browse products across multiple categories, apply filters, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage their profile.

The application includes modern UI/UX features such as dark mode, product modals, cart animations, order history, location detection, and local storage–based persistence, making it a complete learning-oriented e-commerce solution without backend integration.
